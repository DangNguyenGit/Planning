***Feedback We Have Received from the Game***

Music: We have received feedback that the music we used was a bit too tacky (old) and loud. The players said that they could barely hear the soundeffects when the ball hits the paddle and bricks in the game. To help fix these issues we decided to choose a more modern and mellow soundtrack off of youtube. We searched up ChillStep (Chill dubstep music) and ChillWave (Chill Synth Wave Music) to match what our vision of the game was going to be. We also adjusted the db (decibels) of the music to be lower so the background music doesn't drown out the soundeffects in the background. 

Game Aesthetic: We have received feedback on our overall look of our game. Our players have noticed that the overall look of the game was unpleasent to the eyes and a bit outdated. This is due to our choice in color such as black (as the background), green (for the bricks), red (for the ball), and blue (for the paddle).
