**Basic Schedule for Work**
Dang and Abhiram Resposibilities
1. Dang is to mostly focus on the Planning of the Game while working on the code of the game when Abhiram needs the help or when more help is needed for sections of the code
2. Abhiram is to mostly focus on the Coding of the Game while working on the Planning of the game when Dang needs the help or when more help is needed for files of the planning
3. Resposibilites switch once a specfic section of the gameplay (game code) (such as the paddle or the importing of the images as an example) is completed due to the fact that another person joining in the coding may interfere with the other individuals progress.
4. Once the planning is fully complete (before the game as expected) the person working on the Planning will devote their time on the game code as well to complete the game as quick and efficiently as possible.

**Time Schedule**
Both Individuals will split their attention on both Advanced Functions and Computer Science at around 11:30 am (After the Meeting) to 3:00 am (During or After the last Hours of Class)
Individuals with mainly focus on Computer Science at around 5:00 pm (at the earliest) to 9:30 pm assuming there is no Math work or studying required on that given day.

**Why we Chose this Sort of Schedule**
We both determined that this is the most efficient way to complete our game if one person focusses on either the Planning and Game while the other person does the other task.
This allows for both main sections of the Game Projects to be developped at the same time, thus completing the game at a significantly faster rate than focusing on one section at a time.
Even if we don't manage to complete either section (which I doubt) this schedule type also allows us to maximise the points that we could receive in the game project.
Overall we simply determined that this schedule type is the best way to quickly and efficiently complete our entire project.
