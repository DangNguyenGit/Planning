**What We Learned from the Coding (From Test (Base) Code)**

*Adding Images to Game (Code)*
We have first received this code with the help of Ms.Luce but unfortunately could not tune the coding to be suitable for our game.
The code ended up covering up the entire screen with an image, thus making it almost impossible for the player to play the game (due
to the lack of vision of the actual bricks and paddle). From the coding, we have learned how to include an image into the game by turning
the image into an object (JLabel) and inserting it into the game by attaching it into a JFrame. The image can be adjusted by changing the
dimensions of the JFrame and can be visible by using a simple setVisible method. The JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE (with the default close operation code at the top)
also exits the application when the player wants to exit the game as well (unlike the other default close operations availible).
