**Day 1 (January 4, 2021):**

Dang N: 
1. Created the GitHub repository for all of the associated files and documents needed for the
planning phase of the game (still considering whether we should compound the coding into this document as well or seperate the planning and code). 
2. Discussed the general idea and modification needed to be implemented into the
overall game play. 
3. Worked on writing down the progress and planning phase of the game (as of this date)(see general.md date history). Did minor 
research into the gameplay aspect of the game.

Abhiram S: 
1. Did major research into the overall aesthetic aspect of the brick breaker project (such as the look of the paddle itself alongside the look
of the background of the game)
2. Did research and implement/tested gameplay
code for the brick breaker project (the paddle + movements). 
3. Discussed the overall parameters and changes that will be implemented 
within the project (and hopefully executed by the time the game is done).
