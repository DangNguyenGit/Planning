**Day 1 (January 4, 2021):**

Dang N: 
1. Created the GitHub repository for all of the associated files and documents needed for the
planning phase of the game (still considering whether we should compound the coding into this document as well or seperate the planning and code). 
2. Discussed the general idea and modification needed to be implemented into the
overall game play. 
3. Worked on writing down the progress and planning phase of the game (as of this date)(see general.md date history). Did minor 
research into the gameplay aspect of the game.

Abhiram S: 
1. Did major research into the overall aesthetic aspect of the brick breaker project (such as the look of the paddle itself alongside the look
of the background of the game)
2. Did research and implement/tested gameplay
code for the brick breaker project (the paddle + movements). 
3. Discussed the overall parameters and changes that will be implemented 
within the project (and hopefully executed by the time the game is done). 

**Day 2 (Sort of) (January 12, 2021):**

Dang N:
1. Worked on the Planning for the Github Repository (Algorithm and Schedule).
2. Helped out with finding and creating the game assets (such as drawings and photos of the game).
3. Helped fix and figure out some game coding issues in terms of figuring out how to make the images move within the game.

Abhiram S:
1. Worked on figuring out how to make the images move within the game code.
2. Helped figure out the best game assets to include within the game (which images are more suitable for the game theme).
3. Helped out with and worked on the Game UML for the planning of the game.

**Day 3-4 (January 15-16):**

Dang N:
1. Assisted Abhiram in finding videos to help with the coding and assisted Abhiram in finding game assets (ex. Game Font, Game Background, Game Audio clips).

Abhiram S:
1. Looked for game assets for the game (such as fonts, background images, etc.)
2. Worked on figuring out how to make the paddle and bricks of the game turn into images (SCRAPPED)

**Day 5 (January 18):**

Dang N:
1. Worked on some game code (Found out how to create sound effects within the game and helped out with the menu)
2. Helped with some issues with the code (such as figuring out how to call the contents of a different class into the main class / power-ups as well)
3. Helped with the overall aesthetic of the game (such as the game font)
4. Worked on finishing the base code files in the planning phase of the game
5. Fleshed out some aspects of the planning phase

Abhiram S:
1. Worked on figuring out how to include sound effects into the game (COMPLETED)
2. Worked on creating the main menu for the game
3. Found and Implemented the game assets (Sound and Images)
4. Worked on creating the power-ups for the game
5. Began working on creating the UML

**Day 6 (January 19):**
