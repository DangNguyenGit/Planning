## Planning Documents for the Game

**The General Idea of the Game:**

Our group for the game development project have decided to create and modify a simple "brick
breaker" video game. With a group of two people working on this project, we decided that we should make the game more
complex to match the capabilities of both people working on the project. We decided to modifiy small components of the game
such as; creating a opening sequence, a menu page, a game over screen, in-game power-ups or perks. We also had the idea in
improving the assets of the game such as the movable platform, background or even the bricks itself to create a more modern 
version of the game. 

**Basic Gameplay Description:**

The gameplay of the brick breaker game that we are developing will be general the same as a standard brick breaker game. A general 
description of the gameplay would be; "A game where the player is tasked in using a small platform at the bottom of the window, to hit
a singular ball with the goal in breaking all of the brick objects above the platform. The player is also tasked in keeping the ball
above the platform". The platform like every single brick breaker game can only move side to side and not up or down. As mentioned
before in the "General Idea" section of our planning docs, we may include some extra gameplay components such as power-ups and perks
(ex. Extra Balls, Larger Platform, Fast or Slower Moving balls, etc.) These power-up and perks will most likely be the only modification
we will make however, so the additional changes will only be to improving the atmosphere and aesthetic of the game. 

**A General List of Changes and Modifications We Plan To Make**

1. Intro Sequence (INTRO SEQUENCE SCRAPPED) or Menu Page (COMPLETE)
2. Perks / Power-Ups (Bonus Gameplay Material for Players) (IN-PROGRESS)
3. Improvements in the Look of the Game (Player Platform, Background, the Ball) (SOME PARTs SCRAPPED)
4. Game Over Page (COMPLETE)

**Why we Decided on these Changes:**

We decided and agreed on these changes because with the amount of people we have in the group, we personally believe we are capable
enough in executing these changes. Many of these changes are considerably minor in terms of the overall gameplay experience and are
relatively doable in the small time frame we have to complete the entire project. We have also found quite a considerable amount of sources
which have taught us the methods in executing these changes that will be discussed in a later section of the planning document. We have also 
decided to execute a considerable amount of modifications as our project will be weighted and marked differently in comparison to people
who have done the project by themselves.

**Our Vision of What the Game Will Look Like (Layout and Functionality)**

As the player first enters the game they will see either a small intro sequence for the game or
a menu page. This intro sequence will be relatively simple and short (if we decide on creating one) and the
menu screen will be relatively simple, possibly only containing a single "Start Button" and "About Us" selection 
(if we decide on creating a menu screen). Afterwards the player will either select the "Start" button or begin playing the
game. The background and platform of the game would be of a unique look and theme (this section has not been decided yet) which
would be memorable, modern and aesthetically pleasing. The game will then begin as the ball drops down from a previously stationary 
position and the general gameplay will begin. The ball would hit the platform and bounce off in an upwards direction (as expected of the
basic component and gameplay of the game) and hit several blocks above it, which will also match the overall theme. Some blocks may be 
colored or generally visually different from the basic blocks indicating that they contain a perk (these perks are not yet decided upon). If the
player loses, a basic "Game Over" menu/window will appear along side a "Return to Menu" or "Play Again" button. This button should either restart
the game or send the player back to the main menu as shown on the button text.
